# Footer

At the very bottom of the screen is a footer containing some information that may be useful to users.

The left side of the footer displays some information about the application itself.
Here is what the footer displays, listed from left to right:
- Server that Trace is running on
- Archiver URL used by PyDM to fetch archiver data
- Imported config file (if a file was imported/exported; more information here)

  [here]: io.md

The current date and time is displayed on the right side of the footer.
This can be useful if users take a screenshot to share around.
