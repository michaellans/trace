# Configuration Section

The configuration section is where users are able to add axes and traces to the plot as well as configure their appearances.



## Adding Traces

To add traces to the plot, users can type a PV address into the line edit at the top of the section and hit enter or click the "Plot" button.
This will create a trace for the PV and add it to the Y-axis listed last in the configuration section.

Users are able to search for PV(s) by clicking the button labeled "Search PVs" to open the Archive Search Tool.
More information on the tool can be found [here].

## Adding Axes

Users are also able to create new Y-axes using the large button at the bottom of the section labeled "New Axis".
Clicking this will add a new axis to both the plot and the configuration section.



## Hiding Axes & Traces

Users are able to hide traces or axes on the plot without deleting them from the application.
This could be useful if users want to visualize the plot without individual traces, or if there is a lot of clutter.

### From the Section

Axes and all of their curves can be collapsed in the configuration section by clicking the :octicons-chevron-down-12: next to them on the left side of the section.
All of the traces will still appear on the plot.


### From the Plot

Both axes and individual traces can be shown/hidden from the plot by toggling the checkboxes labeled "Active".
