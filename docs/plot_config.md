# Configuring the Plot

The Plot configuration tab is where users get to customize the look of their plot. Plot configuration will be included in the Trace save files, meaning that the customizations can be imported by the user. Customizing the plot can be useful when taking a screenshot of the plot to share.

Below is a brief description of each of the properties that can be customized.



### Plot Title

Allows the user to set the title of their plot to whatever text they want. By default, the plot has no title.


### Grid Lines

Show/hide horizontal and/or vertical grid lines. Both are off by default.


### Legend

Show or hide the plot's legend. The legend will show a list of all traces' labels on the plot and their associated color. There is no customization for the legend yet. The legend is hidden by default.


### Font Size

Control the size of the font on the X-Axis. Shrinking the font will show labels for more tick marks, and increasing it will show fewer. The size can be set within the range [1, 99], and defaults to 12.


### Autoscroll Refresh Rate

Controls how long the autoscroll feature will wait before shifting the plot's timerange to the right. Default is 5 seconds.


### Background Color

Allows the user to set the plot's background color. Default is white.


### Mouse Mode

Users can choose to change the plot's mouse mode when clicking and dragging. The options are Rect (default) or Pan. Rect draws a rectangle between where the mouse is pressed and released, and zooms to show that rectangle. Pan will pan the X and Y axes whichever way the user moves the mouse.


### Opacity

Controls the opacity of the plot's grid lines. Defaults to about 50%.


### Crosshair

Shows a yellow crosshair where the user is mousing over the plot. Disabled by default.
